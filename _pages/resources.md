* Bishop, *"Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning"* (2006): An excellent textbook on probabilistic machine learning. While it was published before the deep learning era, all the concepts are still very important.
* [Havard AM207](https://onefishy.github.io/am207/) *"Stochastic Methods for Data Analysis, Inference and Optimization"*: lecture videos and Python exercises that covers Bayesian inference, latent variable models, MCMC, HMC, and VAE in a logical step-by-step progression.
* Betancourt, [writing](https://betanalpha.github.io/writing/)"*: Comprehensive introduction to probabilistic modeling with lots of code examples in Stan. This level of in-depth discussion is hard to find elsewhere and is very valuable. 
* Tomczak, *"Deep Generative Modeling"* (2022)

* James, Witten, Hastie, and Tibshirani, *"An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R"*, 2nd ed. (2021): ISLR
* Zhang, Lipton, Li, and Smola, *"Dive into Deep Learning"* (2019): [D2L](https://d2l.ai/index.html#): great balance between explanations and code snippets (in PyTorch, MXNet, and TensorFlow)
